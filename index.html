<h2>The Rethomics Package</h2>
<h2>WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION, be patient ;)</h2>

<div class="row">

		<p>
			<i>Rethomics</i> is an <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> package designed to analyse
			high throughput behavioural data.
            At the moment, it focuses on analysing data from the <a href="http://gilestrolab.github.io/ethoscope/">Ethoscope platform</a>
            as well as TriKinetics' <a href="http://www.trikinetics.com/">Drosophila Activity Monitor</a>.
		</p>
		<p>

			It provides:
	    </p>
			<ul>
			  <li> <b>Consistent data import</b> -- the data from different acquisition system will have the same internal structure.</li>
			  <li> <b>Publication quality graph</b> -- Integrated with ggplot.</li>
			  <li> A modern <b>web-interface</b> to control multiple devices effectively.</li>
			  <li> High-throughput detailed post-hock analysis -- thanks to the <b>R package</b> <a href='https://github.com/gilestrolab/rethomics'>rethomics</a>.</li>
			  <li> A <b>modular design</b> -- it is straightforward to modify both devices and software and create new experimental paradigms. </li>
			  <li> A <b>high scalability</b> -- multiple, inexpensive, ethoscopes can run in parallel within the same platform</li>
			</ul>

		<p>
			The aim of this website is to explain how and why using rethomics to analyse large ethological data sets as well as develop a community of users.
