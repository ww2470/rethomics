In this tutorial, we will learn:

* What is `rethomics` 
* How to install it
* The basic principles of the package

`R` and ethomics
-------------------
Science is becoming higher and higher throuput, and the analysis of animal behaviour is taking the same direction.
When dealing with large data sets, it is important to choose a analysis framework that is flexible performant and modular. `R` is the open-source *de facto* state-of-the-art statistical framework, and is used in many area of sciences because it fulfills these criteria.
We developped an `R` package (i.e. toolbox) that allows experimentalist to load their behavioural data, visualise them, and perform subsequent analysis (such as sleep an circadian rythm).

At this point, **if you are not familiar with `R`**, I would strongly recommend to:

* Install [R](https://cran.r-project.org/) and [Rstudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/)
* Learn the basics of `R`. There are hundreads of tutorials, books and lectures online. A good stating point is given [here](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/201141096-Getting-Started-with-R)



Installing `rethomics`
----------------------------------------

### Through CRAN:

Rethomics is not yet on CRAN. Hopefully, this will happen soon!!

### Using `devtools`

`devtools` is an `R` package that facilitates, amonst other things, installation unofficial packages.
First, we can install `devtools` and load it:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("devtools")
library("devtools")
```

Then, we use the `install_github()` function to fetch the latest stable version of `rethomics` directly from our repository:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
install_github("gilestrolab/rethomics", subdir="rethomics")
```

Finally, we should be able to load rethomics:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library("rethomics")
```

Basic concepts
-------------------

This figure represent the typical behavioural analysis workflow.
Regardless of what you want to do with `rethomics`, you will mostl likely go through these steps:

There are three important notions to highlight at this stage:

* Several types of behavioural data -- from different platforms -- can be loaded (e.g., DAM vs Ethoscope).
* Data are loaded though the **query** mechanism, wich is conveninent in an experimental context.
* Once loaded, data from different platforms share the **same internal structure** (`data.table`), so similar plots and analysis can be used regardless of the input type.


In other pages of this tutorial, we will learn [how to write format queries](queries.html), how [behavioural data is stored](data_structure.html) and how to load specific types of behavioural data.
