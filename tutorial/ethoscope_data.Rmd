Aims
----- 

In this tutorial, we will learn:

* How to load data from the ethoscope platform.
* How to use reference time to align experimental times
* How to apply functions on data as they are loaded
* Ways we can speed-up data import

Ethoscope platform
----------------------------------------
Like `rethomics`, the [ethoscope platform](http://gilestrolab.github.io/ethoscope/) is a tool
developed in the [Gilestro lab](http://lab.gilest.ro/), so they should integrate very well.

When working with the ethoscope platform, you will most likely end up with experiments with several devices at different times.
The platform saves one data file per experiment (*i.e.* one machine at one time) in an individual `.db` file (an sqlite3 db).
The files are all organised in a canonical hierarchy:

```
/machine-id/machine-name/datetime/datetime_machine-id.db
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
TUTO_DATA_DIR <- "DEFINE ME!"
```
