<h2>Data</h2>

<p>
    There is only a limited amount of data that can be stored with R packages.
    Therefore, in order to provide a more complete tutorial, we provide a sample dataset.
    It can be downloaded, as a zip archive, <a href="https://imperialcollegelondon.box.com/rethomics-tutorial-data">here</a>.
    Several folders are available in the data set:
</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>ethoscope_results</b>. This is a small sample of ethoscope results. They are organised in the same fashion as the ethoscope stores them.
    <li><b>ethoscope_queries</b>. These are several queries on the ethoscope data sample that can be used as part of the tutorial.
    <li><b>dam_daily_data</b>. This is a small sample of Drosophila Activity Monitor data. They are organised daily (see #TODO).
    <li><b>dam_queries</b>. These are several queries on the DAM daily data sample that can be used as part of the tutorial.
</ul>
